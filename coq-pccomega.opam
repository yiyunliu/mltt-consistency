synopsis: "A short weak normalization (for closed and open terms) proof for a Martin-LÃ¶f-style type theory in Coq" # One-line description
description: """
The mechanized system is most similar to the predicative part of CC
Omega, which is notable for its untyped conversion rule and
cumulativity. We add extensions such as an intensional identity type,
a boolean base type, and a Void type.
Our subtyping relation is contravariant on the argument, unlike CC Omega
or Coq. The semantic model is enough to justify this more flexible design.
